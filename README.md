**noise** is an opinionated, easy-to-use P2P network stack for *decentralized applications, and cryptographic protocols* written in [Go](https://golang.org/) by Perlin Network.
  
**noise** is made to be robust, developer-friendly, performant, secure, and cross-platform across multitudes of devices by making use of well-tested, production-grade dependencies.
  
## Features  
  
- Real-time, bidirectional streaming between peers via. [KCP](https://github.com/xtaci/kcp-go)/TCP and [Protobufs](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
- [NaCL/Ed25519](https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/) scheme for peer identities and signatures.
- Kademlia DHT-inspired peer discovery.  
- Request/Response and Messaging RPC.
- UPnP/NAT Port Forwarding.
- Logging via. [glog](https://github.com/golang/glog).
- Plugin system.

```  
  
  
## Usage  
  
A peer's cryptographic public/private keys are randomly generated/loaded with 1 LoC in mind.  
  
```go  
// Randomly generate a Ed25519 keypair.  
keys := ed25519.RandomKeyPair()  
  
// Load a private key through a hex-encoded string.  
keys := crypto.FromPrivateKey(ed25519.New(), "4d5333a68e3a96d0ad935cb6546b97bbb0c0771acf76c868a897f65dad0b7933e1442970cce57b7a35e1803e0e8acceb04dc6abf8a73df52e808ab5d966113ac")  
  
// Load a private key through a provided 64-length byte array (for Ed25519 keypair).  
keys := crypto.FromPrivateKeyBytes(ed25519.New(), [64]byte{ ...}...)  
  
// Print out loaded public/private keys.  
glog.Info("Private Key: ", keys.PrivateKeyHex())  
glog.Info("Public Key: ", keys.PublicKeyHex())  
```  
  
You may use the loaded keys to sign/verify messages that are loaded as byte arrays.  
  
```go  
msg := []byte{ ... }  
  
// Sign a message.  
signature, err := keys.Sign(ed25519.New(), blake2b.New(), msg)  
if err != nil {  
    panic(err)
}
  
glog.Info("Signature: ", hex.EncodeToString(signature))  
  
// Verify a signature.  
verified := crypto.Verify(ed25519.New(), blake2b.New(), keys.PublicKey, msg, signature)  
  
glog.Info("Is the signature valid? ", verified)  
```  
  
Now that you have your keys, we can start listening and handling messages from incoming peers.  
  
```go  
builder := builders.NewNetworkBuilder()  
  
// Set the address in which peers will use to connect to you.  
builder.SetAddress("tcp://localhost:3000")
  
// Alternatively...  
builder.SetAddress(network.FormatAddress("tcp", "localhost", 3000))
  
// Set the cryptographic keys used for your network.  
builder.SetKeys(keys)  
  
// ... add plugins or set anymore options here.  
  
// Build the network.  
net, err := builder.Build()  
if err != nil {  
    panic(err)
}
  
// Have the server start listening for peers.  
go net.Listen()  
  
// Connect to some peers and form a peer cluster automatically with built-in peer discovery.  
net.Bootstrap("tcp://localhost:3000", "tcp://localhost:3001")
  
// Alternatively..  
net.Bootstrap([]string{"tcp://localhost:3000", "tcp://localhost:3001"}...)
```  
  
If you have any code you want to execute which should only be executed once the node is ready to listen for peers, just run:  
  
```go  
net.BlockUntilListening()  
```  
  
... in any goroutine you desire. The goroutine will block until the server is ready to start listening.  
  
## Plugins  
  
Plugins are a way to interface with the lifecycle of your network.  
  
  
```go  
type Plugin struct{}  
  
func (*Plugin) Startup(net *Network)              {}  
func (*Plugin) Receive(ctx *MessageContext) error { return nil }  
func (*Plugin) Cleanup(net *Network)              {}  
func (*Plugin) PeerConnect(client *PeerClient)    {}  
func (*Plugin) PeerDisconnect(client *PeerClient) {}  
```  
  
They are registered through `builders.NetworkBuilder` through the following:  
  
```go
builder := builders.NewNetworkBuilder()  
  
// Add plugin.  
builder.AddPlugin(new(Plugin))  
```  
  
**noise** comes with two plugins: `discovery.Plugin` and `nat.Plugin`.

```go
// Enables peer discovery through the network. Check documentation for more info.
builder.AddPlugin(new(discovery.Plugin))

// Enables automated UPnP port forwarding for your node. Check docuemntation for more info.
builder.AddPlugin(new(nat.Plugin))
```

Make sure to register `discovery.Plugin` if you want to make use of automatic peer discovery within your application.

## Handling Messages

All messages that pass through **noise** are serialized/deserialized as [protobufs](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
  
Once you have modeled your messages as protobufs, you may process and receive them over the network by creating a plugin and overriding the `Receive(ctx *MessageContext)` method to process specific incoming message types.

Here's a simple example:
  
```go  
// An example chat plugin that will print out a formatted chat message.  
type ChatPlugin struct{ *network.Plugin }  
  
func (state *ChatPlugin) Receive(ctx *network.MessageContext) error {  
    switch msg := ctx.Message().(type) {
        case *messages.ChatMessage:
            glog.Infof("<%s> %s", ctx.Client().ID.Address, msg.Message)
    }
    return nil
}

// Register plugin to *builders.NetworkBuilder.
builder.AddPlugin(new(ChatPlugin))
```  
  
Through a `ctx *network.MessageContext`, you can access flexible methods to customize how you handle/interact with your peer network. All messages are signed and verified with one's cryptographic keys.
  
```go  
// Reply with a message should the incoming message be a request.  
err := ctx.Reply(message here)  
if err != nil {  
    return err
}
  
// Get an instance of your own nodes ID.  
self := ctx.Self()  
  
// Get an instance of the peers ID which sent the message.  
sender := ctx.Sender()  
  
// Get access to an instance of the peers client.  
client := ctx.Client()  
  
// Get access to your own nodes network instace.  
net := ctx.Network()  
```

## Contributions  
  
We at Perlin love reaching out to the open-source community and are open to accepting issues and pull-requests.  
  
For all code contributions, please ensure they adhere as close as possible to the following guidelines:  
  
1. **Strictly** follows the formatting and styling rules denoted [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
2. Commit messages are in the format `module_name: Change typed down as a sentence.` This allows our maintainers and everyone else to know what specific code changes you wish to address.
    - `network: Added in message broadcasting methods.`
    - `builders/network: Added in new option to address PoW in generating peer IDs.`
3. Consider backwards compatibility. New methods are perfectly fine, though changing the `builders.NetworkBuilder` pattern radically for example should only be done should there be a good reason.
